                <p>ABOUT ME</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bio">
                <p>I grew up on the outskirts of Mekele, Tigray, where my childhood experiences shaped my work. I spent my early days attending Orthodox church deaconship lessons, collecting firewood, and bonding with the natural landscape. These memories inspire my artwork, which blends the ancient T'elsem (ጠልሰም) drawing style with modern perspectives. This ancient style, which means "to beautify" in Ge'ez, was taught to me by a bishop from a local monastery.

My work reflects the spiritual and cultural richness of my upbringing. I draw inspiration from my childhood memories—like the bishops' robes, the burning incense, and the atmosphere in the church—translating them into vibrant, thoughtful canvases. Through my unique fusion of tradition and contemporary insight, I continue to explore the deep connection between memory, faith, and art. </p>
